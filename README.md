# Hamming
Collaborative repo for CS300's Final Project at UAB.
Authored by Cutter Crane and David Holmes.

This program implements a solution for decoding and correcting Hamming(7, 4) codes with only one error in the bits. If more than one error is found, the program will instead report that the input holds multiple errors. Documentation for this code was generated with Doxygen, and the unitTests.cpp file holds the unit tests for the program.

For testing, compile with unitTests.cpp in place of main.cpp.
